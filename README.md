## Overview

**STAR Dashboard** (Status Tracking & AI Reporting) is a lightweight, offline-first productivity and tracking dashboard built for **personal use**.
It’s inspired by Task tracking applications - but redesigned for simplicity, complete privacy, and full local control.

Runs locally via **Flask**, stores everything in a local **SQLite** database, and requires no sign-up, network access, or telemetry.

> The **AI Reporting** and analytics module is currently **in development**, but the **task tracking dashboard** is fully functional.
